# Performance-of-Clustering-Algorithms
Supervised algorithms have lots of metrics to check their goodness of fit like accuracy, r-square value, sensitivity etc. but what can we calculate to measure the accuracy or goodness of our clustering technique? The answer to this question is Silhouette Coefficient or Silhouette score.
# Silhouette Coefficient:
The Silhouette coefficient is a value between -1 and 1, where higher values indicate a better clustering. This index is especially useful for high-dimensional datasets where visualizing the clustering's is not possible. We can also calculate the silhouette coefficient for each point, values for individual points are calculated by averaging across clusters or an entire dataset.
